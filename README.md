# .torrent-file-decoder

On my journey of learning about the bittorrent protocol, I came accross the .torrent file format. .torrent files are bencoded dictionaries. To learn more about these .torrent files and bencoding in general, I wrote a simple decoder for .torrent files.

To try it out for yourself:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Japerre/.torrent-file-decoder.git
cd .torrent-file-decoder
ptyhon bparser.py
```
